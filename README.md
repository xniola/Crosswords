# Crosswords
Solver written in LUA of the well-known crossword game (also called crucipuzzle or crosswords)!

Lua is a multi-paradigm language suitable for writing imperative, functional and object-oriented code. 
The solver is available in two formats, one developed via procedural paradigm and the other via functional paradigm.
